			<p>Sociedade Esportiva Palmeiras, or for short Palmeiras, was founded in 1914 by Italian immigrants as "Palestra Itália" as a result of Brazil joining the Allies in the Second World War against Italy.
				The club has used its famously green home kit and has grown into a major influence in the Brazilian football world, with many claiming it to be most successful club in South America as of the recent years.
				This is reflected by its winning history as Palmeiras holds the for record 12 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A trophies, 28 Paulista trophies, 4 Copas do Brasil, 1 Copa dos 
				Campeões, 2 Libertadores, and 1 Supercopa do Brasil making it the most successful club in top-tier domestic competitions in Brazil. This is also MY CLUB! &#128521;

			<p>Founded in 1930 as a merge between Club Athletico Paulistano and Associação Atlética das Palmeiras, the club has used its traditional home kit of a white shirt with two horizontal stripes (one red and one black).
				São Paulo is a national team and the third best-supported club in Brazil, with over 22 million supporters, covering around 9.9% of its population. Their supporters are called são-paulinos, and these have recently
				had the experience of winning the Copa do Brasil for the first time in its history in 2023. Other recent events include the 2024 Supercopa do Brasil championship and the historically impressive
				event of winning the Serie A national league title 3 years in a row in 2006, 2007 and 2008. And also, the 5x0 defeat playing in Palmeiras' home stadium in 2023 was remarkable!

			<p>Sport Club Corinthians Paulista, known simply as Corinthians, was founded in 1910 by five railway workers inspired by the London-based Corinthian Football Club. Corinthians traditionally plays in a white 
				and black home kit and it is one of the most widely supported teams in the world and the second most in Brazil, with over 30 million fans. In retrospect, recent events include the 2018 Campeonato Paulista championship for the 29th time, this time against their biggest rivals, Palmeiras. Just a year later, in 2019, Corinthians won the Campeonato Paulista for the 30th time. 
				In 2020 however, Corinthians lost the Campeonato Paulista final to arch rivals Palmeiras on penalties.
