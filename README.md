# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
This is a summary of the sample websites I made with my new knowledge of HTML and CSS.

<h1>The SquarePants Burgers Site</h1
<p>Inspired by the retro Pokemon-based example website, I followed the retro vibe and brought life to a real-life business that has gained popularity in its local community for its SpongeBob appeal. I realised this business does not currently have an official website, which prompted me to be the one to change this in a simple way.

<h1>Pop-up Cinema Site</h1
<p>Diving deeper into HTML and CSS development, this was reinforced when I was tasked to create a website promoting "Academy Pop-Up Cinema" using Bootstrap styling this time. Academy is a fictional venture that aims to bring its local community together by providing entertainment with top-quality movies to be enjoyed outdoors.  

<h1>Football One-Page Site</h1
<p>Given the task to create an HTML page, this time I decided to showcase some of my passion for football by presenting my club Palmeiras and its two biggest rivals in the Sao Paulo state, Brazil. I went above and beyond to research different methods from various sources so that I could make this page as aesthetic and clean-looking as possible.
